<p>Here are some notes on the set up and some hints.</p>

<p>What I did to install it is in <a href="https://github.com/libbymiller/speakingbox">github</a>.

<p>The tensorflow machine learning part is in <code>classify_image_server.py</code> in the <code>/home/pi/</code> 
directory, but you most likely don't need to touch that part.</p>

<p>You might like to edit <code>classify_image_client.py</code> which handles the button press and talks to the 
<code>classify_image_server.py</code> via http on port 8080</p>

<p>buttons.py shows you a different way of talking to the buttons. There's more information about the phatbeat 
library in <a href="http://docs.pimoroni.com/phatbeat/">the phatbeat docs</a> - you can also use it to set the 
led pixels too, as well as the buttons.

<p><code>classify-image-server.service</code> and <code>classify-image-client.service</code> are just a way of 
making it start automatically. More details about that are at the end of <a 
href="https://github.com/libbymiller/speakingbox/blob/master/README.md">the installation README file</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to change it, make edits to <code>classify_image_client.py</code> and then restart the client:</p>

<p><code>sudo systemctl restart classify-image-client.service</code></p>

<p>To restart the server (which you probably don't want to do unless it starts saying the same thing over and over 
again), do:</p>

<p><code>sudo systemctl restart classify-image-server.service</code></p>

<p>you can also do sudo systemctl stop [service] or sudo systemctl start [service]</p>

<p>If you have trouble look in the system logs, e.g.</p>

<p><code>tail -f /var/log/syslog</code></p>

<p>and you can always reboot it: <code>sudo reboot</code>.</p>

<p>If you see stuff in the logs about the camera not being connected, check that the connector is correctly in the 
pi, with the blue part facing the ethernet port, and that the tiny connector on the camera has not become 
disconnected.</p>

<p>Your last image (taken when you press the button) is camlive.jpg<p>
